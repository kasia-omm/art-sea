# Testing

### Bug 1
After adding content that was copied from index.html page to  services.html page, the services.html stopped working as per screenshot below:

<a href="/assets/images/bug1.png">Bug 1</a> FIX THIS IMAGE AS IT DOESN'T SHOW

Bug was fixed by temporarily commenting out code copied from main page info section in the services.html section. I then realised that the codes for the <nav></nav> section contained spaces and services.html page name started with Capital letter. After correcting all those, services.html page started working again.

<em>Note: I realised that website is not deployed and link is breaking each time I open the portal. This bug will need to be fixed once the website is deployed.</em>

### Bug 2 

I realised that I downloaded the largest images rather than small so I needed to replace exising images in the assets/images folder to smaller.
