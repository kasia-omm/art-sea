# [ArtSea](https://kasia-omm.github.io/art-sea/) - where art and craft meets fun!
### ArtSea was created from the need of alternative party provider in the North West.<br> Surrounded by the ocean and beautful mountains, Sligo is nuber 1 place to celebrate your special occasion. ArtSea provides fun, creative and different birthday, stag and hen parties as well as corporate or miscellaneous group events. The purpose of this website is to provide information for potential party organisers about the range of services on offer and how to get in touch to enquire or book the event.<br>

#### Inspired by the colours of ArtSea branding, their unique craft and destory room and considering that 90% of their customer base are women, I chose popular green and pink colours for the main colour theme. The user should straight away be able to recognise the fact that this website is about a business that deals with art through various icons and images resembling art & craft.<br>

#### The website consists of three pages, giving the first time user an opportunity to get to know ArtSea, learn about sample activities and full range of services on offer. There is also a contact page that allows the user to promptly contact ArtSea for their services.

    </ul>

By keeping the same style and format across the website pages, user receives consistency across sections with some elements adapted to the size of the screen for ease of access. The navigation menu remians the same across all pages, the footer changes with the addition of a map on Services and Contact Us pages, which seemed more appropriate for added value to the user. The first page and thank you page have a site map with navigation to other pages. 

Footer contains interactive fields such as telephone number and email. User may click on each field which in return brings them to the calling service provider such as Skype or email provider set as default on their device. This added feature provides additional functionality and provide faster opportunity of potential contact. Copy and paste of telephone number or email is eliminated. Each field opens up in a separate window as per guidelines. 

# UX/UI

## Site Goals

ArtSea site goal is to encourage the user to choose ArtSea for their party. In order to achieve this goal, user must find the navigation through the website quick an easy. According to The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) [WCAG](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30557/6-guidelines-for-exceptional-website-design-and-usability.aspx) websites must be 

Perceivable: Visitors are aware of the content on your site.<br>
Operable: The functionality of your website should be possible in different ways.<br>
Understandable: All content and alerts can be easily understood.<br>
Robust: Your website is usable across different assistive technologies, devices, and browsers.<br>

>Perceivable: Visitors are aware of the content on your site.<br>

User is aware of the content of the website as information is clearly laid out, intuitive and presented with high contrast 

>Operable: The functionality of your website should be possible in different ways.<br>

User is able to operate the website on various size devices, from mobile phones, through tablets and desktops to large screen monitors. All links enclosed within the websites are working and alternative titles are provided if such a case should happen that the link or image was to become broken.

>Understandable: All content and alerts can be easily understood.<br>

User is able to understand the content and may navigate through photos and videos as required. Videos are not on autoplay and form fields as well as buttons are fully functional. 

>Robust: Your website is usable across different assistive technologies, devices, and browsers.<br>

Visually impaired user will be able to use a text reader that will have no problem reading out each section of the website with alternative and aria labels provided. 

Summing all up, ArtSea website is accessible for all users.

<hr>

The navigation of the website attracts the user to navigate to Contact Us form. On the Main Page, there is a link to go directly to Services Page from which user may navigate to Contact Us form after learning about services.

There are several call to action buttons on the Main Page such as 'Let's craft!' on the overlay text box on Hero Image, as well as Contact Us link in the footer.  

![Call to Action](assets/readme-images/call-to-action.png)

## Design choices

The design of the website focusses on the art and craft part of the business choosing lively colours and images that are in line with branding and general business theme. First time user knows straight away that the website is about party packages that involve creativity and art.

<ol>Theme colors:</ol>
<li>Header and Footer - #41B3A3</li>
<li>Sections title backgrounds - #C38D9E</li>
<li>Button background - aliceblue </li>
<li>Text color - #000F04</li>
<li>Bold text - #384955</li>

<span width="100" height="100">![ArtSea_Color_Palette](/assets/images/ArtSea_color_palette_smaller.png)<span>

The general rule for the website was to keep the navigation menu and footer the same across all pages. The main page footer differs from Services page or Contact Us page, as the objective was to enhance users' experience by making it easier for them to navigate to other pages of the website from the main page. Therfore, the decision was made to include site map with links to other pages on the main page and replace it with Google map on the other two pages. By doing so, user can quickly navigate to other pages and find the location of the business on their navigation journey. This also allows to keep the flow throughout all pages.<br>

In the footer, for ease of access, links were added to external telephone calling and emailing clients, making it easy for user to contact ArtSea.<br>

The hero image thatwas chosen for the main page makes the user feel that they landed on the right page if they are looking for art and craft party supplier. It gives the page the urban, freestyle feel and makes the user interested in what ArtSea has on offer. The text overlay brings attention to statements that make the user curious to find out more about this unique experience at ArtSea. It also specifies location so that users that are from far abroad do not waste their time if they landed on the page and are unable to travel thus far.<br>

The interactive and responsive round buttons on the main page create a clean structured format and bring attention to the services on offer. After clicking, tey bring the user to the required section on the website, without opening in the new tab, allowing for the user to stay on the page as long as possible.<br>

There was a request to showcase some of the activities offered at ArtSea and this was achieved by creating small galleries with shadow frames keeping the style and colours within the colour palette of the website. Small captions at the bottom of the page explain the activities allowing users to understand what they are.<br>

The Contact Us page inludes a form, which has required fields specified. Among First and Last Name, there is a phone number, and email address. When it comes to the telephone number, there was a conscious decision made to use input type="text" instead of input type="tel". If tel input type was specified this filed would have been validated and number of different country codes therfore for users' ease of access the field was changed to text with recommended phone number format placeholder.<br>

## Wireframes

Wireframes help determine what route to go with the website design. Initially I created them by hand and used them as a reference to what the website should look like. During the design process, some features that looked good on paper, transcribed into other features that simply made more sense after doing some research. I focused on desktop website size during this website design. In the future I will definitely take a mobile first approach and focus on getting the smaller screen size responsiveness limiting the number of css rules as a result. 

Below wireframe was created as a starting point of the design. 

![Wireframe 1](assets/readme-images/Home-Page-WIREFRAME.png)

# Testing

Testing the website took plase throughout the design process. It invloved checking if website works on different web browser, wheter it is responsive and if html and css files go through the validation without throwing out any errors. Any errors that were spotted throughout the design are documented in this section.<br>

As this is a static website, testing is performedon the visual aspect of the website.<br>
Sections should not overalp, text should be clearly visible and not go out of a specified section. Images should load and if the link for some reason appears to be broken, the alternative description should be displayed. Testing was performed on at least two web browsers and for all screen sizes. Any link included onthe website should direct the user to the correct section of the website. 

The table below represents testing of the website with expected outcome and the actual test result.


### Bug 1
After adding content that was copied from index.html page to  services.html page, the services.html stopped working as per screenshot below:

![Bug 1](/assets/images/bug1.png)

Bug was fixed by temporarily commenting out code copied from main page info section in the services.html section. I then realised that the codes for the <nav></nav> section contained spaces and services.html page name started with Capital letter. After correcting all those, services.html page started working again.

![Bug 1 Fixed](/assets/images/Bug1_Fixed.png)

<em>Note: I realised that website is not deployed and link is breaking each time I open the portal. This bug will need to be fixed once the website is deployed.</em>

<em>Note: After brainstorming with mentor, I came to the conclustion that I shouldn't be using a full http link to the page where user should be directed to, but a relative link instead. Correcting this issue resolved the problem with link breaking.</em>

### Bug 2 

I realised that I downloaded the largest images rather than small so I needed to replace exising images in the assets/images folder to smaller.

### Bug 3 

On main page when I clicked on Lets's party! button, it was opening page in a separate tab but with error 404: File not found as per image below. I fixed it by correcting href link as services.html page name changed from Capital letter to small letter. 

# Deployment

Before deployment may happen, the website is designed in GitHub and GitPod. The following stepse were taken for building ArtSea website:

**To create a GitHub repository follow the steps:**

Step 3: Click on use this template<br>
Step 4: Create a repository name and add description for the website (name must be unique)<br>
Step 5: Click create repository from template<br> 
Step 6: Click on GitPod to create a Workspace for your repoitory

**To open workspace in GitPod follow the steps:**

Step 1: Log in to GitPod<br>
Step 2: Click on your icon and navigate to Workspaces
Step 3: Click on the Workspace you want to work on (inactive workspaces are deleted after 14 days, however if you pushed your code to GitHub, you will be able to open the Workspace again)<br>
Step 4: Make any required changes to your code and git add . git commit and git push as you go<br>
